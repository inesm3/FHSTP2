Project: Hearing Test
Goal: Create a flow chart which resembles the improvement or the deterioration of the hearing level from ones appointment to another

User-Input: Users can put in the date and hearing level at a specific frequency in a table
The table on the website should have two columns (the frequency and the hearing level) and one text field for the date.
The frequencies from 125 Hz to 8000 Hz should be already given.
The cells for the hearing levels should be an empty text field, where the users put in the decibel from the hearing test.

Output: A flow chart which resembles the changes 
The flow chart should represent the improvement or the deterioration of the hearing level. As a lower number of decibel is considered better hearing, the lower numbers resemble improvement.
